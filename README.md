# rhythm-as-a-system

# Project Overview: 
Rhythm is a wellness-centered, context-aware system that helps users align their workload, energy, and daily responsibilities. Instead of trying to classify people or infer mental states, Rhythm focuses on recovery, exposure, and friction signals to identify recurring work conditions. By integrating behavioral, physiological, and calendar data, it provides gentle, actionable guidance so users can make realistic decisions that support both productivity and well-being.

# System Functionality:
Rhythm is designed for users who already rely on multiple tools to manage their day. Rather than replacing these tools, it integrates their signals to translate effort and capacity into actionable guidance through three core functions:
1. Data Collection
-   Recovery signals → measure how prepared the body is for effort:
-     Wearable data: sleep, HRV, recovery, activity levels
-     Optional check-ins: perceived energy or restfulness
-   Exposure signals → measure task and environmental load:
-     Calendar: meetings, deadlines, scheduled tasks, buffer times
-     Behavioral: session length, tab switching, task switching frequency
-   Friction signals → measure effort or difficulty experienced during tasks:
-     Behavioral: task fragmentation, interruptions
-     Optional check-ins: perceived effort, task difficulty
2. Context Interpretation
-   Clusters work conditions, not people, based on recurring patterns
-   Calculates recovery, exposure, and friction scores
-   Detects misalignment between current capacity and task demands
-   Continuously adapts to improve future guidance
3. Personalized Guidance
- Provides capacity-respecting suggestions (focus sessions, work prioritization, or recovery activities)
- Offers subtle workload adjustments if demands exceed current capacity
- Generates reflective summaries through the menu bar or dashboard
- Preserves user agency by inviting confirmation rather than imposing labels
